I am checking out some content in [*Statistics for Soil Survey*](http://ncss-tech.github.io/stats_for_soil_survey/), the original impetus was to prep my R skill and RDA with R, which is covered in [chapter 4](http://ncss-tech.github.io/stats_for_soil_survey/chapters/4_exploratory_analysis/4_exploratory_analysis.html)
