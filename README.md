# Statistics for Soil Survey

I am checking out some content in [*Statistics for Soil Survey*](http://ncss-tech.github.io/stats_for_soil_survey/) by Tom Dâ€™Avello and Stephen Roecker. The original impetus was to prep my R skill and RDA with R, which is covered in [chapter 4](http://ncss-tech.github.io/stats_for_soil_survey/chapters/4_exploratory_analysis/4_exploratory_analysis.html). The book/site has [it's own GitHub repo](https://github.com/ncss-tech/stats_for_soil_survey), and [other resources from National Cooperative Soil Surve (NCSS)](https://github.com/ncss-tech) are available too.
